This project has been developed using the PyCharm IDE of the JetBrains License.
The Python interpreter and compiler used are Python 3.7.0, so the project should
work with any Python 3 compiler.
To run this project with PyCharm, select Run in the Run menu.

The project files are structured like this :
 - Graph.py contains all graph basics functions needed, such as reading  graph
   from a file or getting the vertices;
 - Stable.py contains all the functions needed for the project, such as the exact
   method and the approximate method;
 - Main.py contains the main instructions to read the instances and use the two
   methods.

All the instances were generated using the functions at the end of the file
Graph.py.
